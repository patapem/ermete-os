# Retention of the kernel OCI packages on ghcr (docs/architecture/doc_kernel_build.md,
# section 3, step 8). A version (= one manifest) survives if it is reachable from a
# retained release; everything else is deleted.
#
# Release: a manifest carrying a tag that does not start with `sha256-` (the NVR,
# `latest`). The KEEP most recent ones survive: all of them for kernel and devel, two
# for the debuginfo. Reachable from a release with digest sha256:<hex>:
#   - the manifests tagged `sha256-<hex>*`: the referrers index that cosign v3 updates
#     under the fallback tag `sha256-<hex>` (ghcr has no referrers API: GET
#     /v2/<repo>/referrers/<digest> answers 404) and the legacy `.sig`, `.att`, `.sbom`
#     tags;
#   - the members of that index, i.e. the Sigstore bundles of the signature and the
#     attestations, which are untagged manifests: their list comes from the registry,
#     not from the packages API.
# Deleted, therefore: the releases beyond KEEP together with their referrers, the
# indexes superseded by every later `cosign sign|attest`, and the manifests left by a
# repeated push of the same tag. The workflow gate verifies the signature AFTER the
# retention: should this model stop holding (ghcr with a referrers API, cosign without
# the fallback tag) the run would fail.
#
# Usage: retention.sh [--dry-run]. Needs gh with read:packages and delete:packages (in
# CI the GITHUB_TOKEN with packages: write) and skopeo authenticated to ghcr (buildah
# login).
