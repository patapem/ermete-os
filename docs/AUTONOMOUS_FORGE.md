# Athanor OS: Autonomous Kernel & Spec Forge

This document delineates the cutting-edge architecture designed for the continuous self-maintenance of the Athanor OS hybrid Chimera Kernel and RPM package repository. The primary directive of this infrastructure is to ensure that the operating system remains perpetually synchronized with upstream sources (Fedora ARK) and optimized with maximum performance patches (CachyOS / Clear Linux) within a zero-trust, highly automated build ecosystem.

## 1. Architectural Vision

Maintaining a hyper-competitive, immutable operating system—one that rivals and surpasses custom kernels such as CachyOS or Clear Linux in execution speed—requires the continuous ingestion and fusion of external patchsets and `x86-64-v3` optimized spec definitions.

The **Autonomous Forge** automates dependency graph resolution, `.spec` file patching, and deterministic extraction of RPM source trees through the **Chimera Bedrock** engine.

## 2. System Components

The infrastructure comprises modular, hermetically isolated pillars:

### A. Chimera Bedrock Builder (`prepare-chimera.sh`)
The core orchestrator responsible for compiling the Chimera Kernel:
1. **Dynamic Ceiling (NVIDIA Shield)**: Queries installed proprietary NVIDIA driver releases and dynamically calculates the maximum allowable kernel release ceiling to eliminate ABI regressions and display crashes.
2. **Dominant Matrix (CachyOS + Clear Linux)**: Pulls and prioritizes patches (`SOURCES/bedrock-*`) combining the BORE (Burst-Oriented Response Enhancer) scheduler with Clear Linux memory/CPU optimizations.
3. **AST & Kconfig Tuning**: Injects specialized kernel configuration fragments (`athanor-bedrock.cfg`) enforcing `CONFIG_SCHED_BORE=y`, `CONFIG_HZ_1000=y`, `CONFIG_PREEMPT=y`, `CONFIG_LTO_CLANG_THIN=y`, and `-O3 -march=x86-64-v3`.

### B. Micro-Container OCI Packaging (`build_rolling_local.sh`)
- Executes isolated RPM compilations inside ephemerally spawned OCI micro-containers (`scratch` or `fedora:43`).
- Sandboxing prevents host toolchain contamination and ensures build reproducibility.
- Deterministically exports build artifacts to `~/.rpmbuild/RPMS/`.

## 3. Security & Efficiency Architecture

- **OCI Isolation**: Every build execution runs in unprivileged, ephemeral container enclaves.
- **Deterministic Hashing**: SHA-256 digests over `.spec` files and source tarballs prevent redundant re-compilations across CI/CD matrices.
- **Autonomous Fall-back**: Upon compilation or patch application failure, the pipeline aborts execution instantly and emits detailed diagnostic diagnostics to the Architect log bus.
